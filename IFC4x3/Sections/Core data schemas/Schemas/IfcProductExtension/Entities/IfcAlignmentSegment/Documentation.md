An IfcAlignmentSegment is a segment of an IfcAlignment where either the vertical direction or horizontal direction or cant (in the case of trackdesign) obey a unique mathematical description as a function of chainage where chainage is the longitudinal distance along the horizontal projection of the whole alignment.

Note 1 to entry: Unless otherwise stated, for railway, the appertaining track alignment design parameters are defined for the track centreline.

Note 2 to entry: For roads, the alignment typically describes the path of the road centerline, but in certain situations, e.g. ramps, the alignment may describe the path of other edges of the road body
