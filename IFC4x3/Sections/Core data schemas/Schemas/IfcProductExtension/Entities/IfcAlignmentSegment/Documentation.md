**Road domain definition**
An IfcAlignmentSegment is a segment of the road centerline with either vertical direction or horizontal direction obeying a unique mathematical description as a function of chainage.


**Rail domain definition**
An IfcAlignmentSegment is a segment of the track with either vertical direction, horizontal direction or cant obeying a unique mathematical description as a function of chainage

Note 1 to entry: Unless otherwise stated, the appertaining track alignment design parameters are defined for the track centre line and the longitudinal distance for the track centre line is defined in a projection in a horizontal plane.

Chainage is the longitudinal distance along the horizontal projection of the track centre line.
